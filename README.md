# primitive-perceptron
This repository contains a simple implementation of the perceptron algorithm in Python, a type of artificial neural network used for binary classification. This is my first attempt at implementing a perceptron based on my knowledge acquired in my first AI class. The implementation is well-documented and follows best practices for Python code.
